    "\n",
    "Since one would expect that the larger the **input size** of the problem, the more **CPU time**, and space one would use to perform the task.\n",

    "### Experimental VS Theoretical Analysis of Algorithms and Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In experimental analysis, one is concerned with measuring **the time it takes to execute an algorithm or perform a data structure operation (access data), and the space used in the organization of data in a data structure**. But in this approach;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the implementation of **the** algorithm and **designing or choosing** a data structure to analyze it, must be performed in order to carry out the experimental analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Since significant amount of time is spent in designing an algorithm and choosing a data structure, then it would be a waste of the programmers effort if the algorithm doesn't measure up to expectation. Hence, having a **high-level** analysis of the algorithm without implementing it, will save a lot of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It is possible for the running time of two algorithms to differ due to several factors\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Different hardware environment will measure different running time. An hardware environment with a faster processor will have a shorter time compared with one with a slower processor, all other factors being constant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - On the same hardware, the context of the CPU (i.e. what the CPU was doing before executing the algorithm), before executing the algorithm will determine the running time of the algorithm. Switching execution context between threads or processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - OS scheduling of tasks will also affect, since our program must wait for the OS to schedule it for execution before running\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A compiled programming language will execute the algorithm faster than an interpreted programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The experiments can only be carried out on a **limited set of test inputs**, thereby neglecting the running times of the inputs not included in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this challenges are easily overcome in theoretical (high-level) analysis of an algorithm, which measures efficiency of an algorithm or data structure as a function of input size, independently of the hardware and software environments.\n",
