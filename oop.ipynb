    "\n",
    "### What is OOP, and its goal?\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of OOP is tied to goals of correct functional software system; A correct software implementation must be such that it is;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Robustness**: ability to handle unexpected inputs that are not explicitly defined in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adaptability**: This is the ability of a software program to be capable of evolving in response to changing conditions, **with little efforts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reusability**: this is the ability of a software program to easily fit as component of different systems in different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP is an attempt to facilitate the goals of software programs listed above; It achieves this under three general principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Modularity**: \n",
    "Dividing a software systems into interacting components that represents a seperate functional unit. That is, each component performs a well defined function, and when fitted with other components, forms a unifying whole of the entire software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is achieved with **modules** in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "With a software system separated into interacting components, it easier to test each component seperately, it is easy to evolve the component, and a given component can easily be fitted into another application easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Abstraction**: \n",
    "\n",
    "This involves breaking down a software system into its most fundamental parts, which in turns gives a **model** of the software system; explaining the function, the components and how they interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract data type is an example an abstraction of a data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Abstract Data Types (ADT)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a mathematical model of a data structure that specifies;\n",
    "\n",
    "- the **type** of **data** stored\n",
    "- the **operations** supported on the data structure\n",
    "- the **types** of **parameters** of the operation; i.e. what do is need to perform the operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the **ADT specifies** ***what*** each operation does, and **NOT how** the operations are performed. And the **collective set of behaviours (operations)** supported by an ADT is referred to as its **public interface**.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does a user of a public interface knows which types to pass to it? \n",
    "\n",
    "When a given method can be passed on the object; hence behaviour of an object in python is a stand-in for the type of that object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract Base Class (ABC):\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Python mechanism for supporting abstract data types. An ABC cannot be instantiated, rather it defines a common set of methods that all implementation of the abstraction must have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python has no compile-time type checking, it relies on whether a given method can be called on an object. If the said method can be called on the object then we say it behaves like the type expected; in fact we say it is the type expected - this is known as **duck typing**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "This is similar to the **trait** system in Rust, where\n",
    "\n",
    "- the Trait itself acts like an abstract base class, providing a set of functions (methods), and\n",
    "\n",
    "- any type implementing that trait (acts like; classes inheriting the abstract base class) must implement those methods\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Encapsulation**: \n",
    "\n",
    "This involve hiding the internal details (i.e. implementation details )of a public interface from a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "This describe a solution to a typical software design problem. A pattern provides general template for a solution that can be applied in many different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **name**: identifies the pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **context**: scenarios *where* the pattern can be applied\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **template**: describes *how* the pattern is applied\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **result**: which describes and analyzes what the pattern produces\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two Categories of Design Patters;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm Design Patterns**\n",
    "\n",

    "\t- Amortization\n",
